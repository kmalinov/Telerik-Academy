//04. Print a Deck

//Description

//Write a program that reads a card sign(as a string) from the console and generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 
//52 cards up to the card with the given sign(without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5 of spades, 
//A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).

//The card faces should start from 2 to A(10 is 10).
//Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.
